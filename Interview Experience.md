Mindset & Personality Development
No matter how skilled you are, if you arenâ€™t a good communicator, things can turn against you. There are certain questions that interviewers ask almost every candidate, in an attempt to get a read on their personality and potential. Youâ€™ll likely be asked about your strengths and weaknesses, your leadership style, and other basic professional attributes. This LinkedIn course will help you understand the psychology behind the questions.

Lastly, some underrated advice. You can skip this if you feel too confident :)

Dopamine detox
I donâ€™t know where youâ€™re coming from, but if you are someone who gets distracted easily, you may follow these steps:

Dopamine detox
Try to incorporate a fitness regime
Eat clean food
Caffeine, maybe?
Envision yourself in your dream company â€” Yes, that should be your dopamine rush
Meditation can be helpful too
I personally am a fitness freak. Iâ€™ve been lifting for the past 6 years now. Every morning I chugged my caffeine pills and hit an intense weight training session. That helped me stay focused for the rest of the day.

Enjoy the process than the outcome

IKIGAI
Itâ€™s the passion that should drive the fire inside you.
Good things take time.
Results are just a matter of time.
The interview always has a touch of a lottery.
A big part of it is pure luck.
Stop taking this personally and start treating it like a game or a sport that requires strategy and prep.
An interview is a 2-way street, think of it as a discussion
Rejection? I call it free practice!

Just do what needs to be done and donâ€™t care about results.

I recently joined the company I was literally dreaming of! Had lots and lots of learnings during my prep and interview cycles. And what gets me excited is that this is just the beginning of my journey at Flipkart. I hope this will help you ace your interviews. But what about landing an interview? Well, thatâ€™s a story for another day!
